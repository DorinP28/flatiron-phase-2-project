      <h2>About Our Store</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to DevTees, your one-stop-shop for the most creative and quirky developer T-shirts! We understand that as software developers, you're not just
        about codes and coffee. You have a unique sense of humor that deserves to be shared and appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our T-shirts are a perfect blend of comfort, style and a dash of humor. Each design is carefully chosen to resonate with your life as a developer - from
        the joy of solving complex problems, to the delight of finding the perfect algorithm, and the occasional frustrations of debugging that piece of code.
      </p>
      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        At DevTees, our mission is to give software developers a fun and stylish way to express their unique perspective. We believe in celebrating the wit,
        wisdom, and whimsy of the developer life. Our T-shirts are not just about making a fashion statement, but also about building a community that
        appreciates the lighter side of programming.
      </p>
